# How it works

The YEN project allows you to test up to 8 systems using only 2 analog pins. The system consists of two parts: Voltage Controlled MUX (MUX) and a block of test circuits. VCMUX works like any other MUX. In this case it has 8 analog inputs and 1 output. However, it is not controlled digitally but analogously. We apply a voltage from 0V to 1.8V to one of the pins of the system. The circuit has been designed in such a way that we have 8 thresholds every 200mV. Depending on the voltage provided, a different test circuit is connected to the second pin of the system. In this simple way, the number of systems that can be tested increases dramatically using only 2 pins.

Below are the thresholds and their arrangements:
0-200mV - nothing is connected to the output. We are investigating the interrogations and what kind of situation will arise in such a situation.
200mV-400mV - Ring oscillator consisting of 3 inverters.
400mV-600mV - Output of the ZQ T Flip Flop connected to a 5-ring inverter oscillator (it should be a frequency divider)
600mV-800mV - Ring oscillator consisting of 5 inverters.
800mV-1V - Output of Q T Flip Flop connected to 5 ring inverter oscillator (should be a frequency divider)
1V-1.2V - Ring oscillator consisting of 7 inverters.
1.2V-1.4V - Signal ring oscillator consisting of 7 inverters passed through an inverter with minimal dimensions.
1.4V-1.6V - Ring oscillator consisting of 5 inverters and capacitors.
1.6V-1.8V - Voltage from the resistor divider (about 0.2V)

The whole thing should not draw more than 1mA of current.

# How to test

Test 0 - is the system alive?
Apply 1.8V (supply voltage) to ua[1] and see if ua[0] is set to approximately 200mV.

Test 1 - Switching Thresholds.
Apply DC voltage to UA[1] in the range 0-1.8V (preferably in 1mV steps). Record at what point the system switches. This should be visible by changing the oscillation frequency or setting a constant voltage at ua[0].

Test 2 - System performance.
Now that you know each threshold, test each circuit. For example:
set to ua[1] 300mV. On ua[0] you should see the ring output of the oscillator consisting of 3 inverters. Record frequency, apmlidute peak-peak and DC level. If so, can you also take a photo of the shape of the clock.
